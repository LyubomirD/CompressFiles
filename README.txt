Compress Audio File

I recently completed my first freelance software project, and it was quite an interesting experience.
The project involved helping a professor who was facing technical difficulties by developing a program to compress his computer files.
Despite the time constraint, I saw it as a personal challenge and managed to deliver the software in just three days.

While I acknowledge that the user interface may not be visually appealing and there is room for optimization and further improvements,
it's important to note that the primary goal was to address the professor's urgent need. Given the tight deadline,
I focused on functionality and delivering a working solution.
